# Linear Regression ( sklearn & statsmodels in Python)
Please visit my **.pdf file** for some theoretical explanations.

In **code.py** you will see:

- Implementation of linear regression from **"scikit-learn"** and **"statsmodels"** in Python

- **Standardization** and **Normalization** of the features before fitting the model

- Creating new features with **Polynomial Features** algorithm

- Avoiding **Overfitting** with **"Cross-Validation"**
