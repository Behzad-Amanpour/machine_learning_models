# Decision Tree (sklearn in Python)
Please visit my **Decision Tree.pdf file** for some theoretical explanations.

In **code.py** you will see:

- Implementation of Decision Tree (DT) from "scikit-learn" in Python

- **Cross-validation** of DT

- **Pruning (Regularization)** of DT

- **Optimization** of DT (**Grid Search** for DT Parameters)

In **visualization.py** you will see how to plot a decision tree
