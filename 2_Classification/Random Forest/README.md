# Random Forest (sklearn in Python)
Please keep in mind that Random Forest (RF) is an ensembling learning model.

Please visit my **.pdf file** for some theoretical explanations.

In **code.py** you will see:

- Implementation of RF and Decision Tree (DT) from "scikit-learn" in Python

- **Cross-validation** of RF

- **Optimization (Tuning)** of RF (**Grid Search** for the number of DTs)
